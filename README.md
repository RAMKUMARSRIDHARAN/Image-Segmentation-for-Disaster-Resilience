# Image-Segmentation-for-Disaster-Resilience

Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive system for detecting and assessing natural disaster impact using satellite and drone imagery. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, it classifies and segments areas affected by events such as floods, landslides, and structural collapses.

The system plays a crucial role in:

Emergency response coordination

Resource allocation

Long-term recovery and mitigation strategies

Future upgrades include support for higher-resolution imagery, real-time analysis, and automated reporting pipelines.

üõ∞Ô∏è Key Features
Image Segmentation
Detects and highlights affected regions in satellite or aerial imagery using pixel-wise classification.

Deep Learning Models
Integrates state-of-the-art architectures like:

U-Net

DeepLabV3+

Mask R-CNN
for accurate and efficient segmentation.

Change Detection
Compares before-and-after disaster images to evaluate damage levels and estimate impact severity.

Disaster Response Utility
Helps authorities and emergency teams map critical zones, prioritize rescue missions, and generate impact reports.

Web Dashboard (Optional)
Interactive interface to visualize:

Segmentation maps

Heatmaps of damage zones

Downloadable reports and overlays
